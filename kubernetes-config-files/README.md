# Kubernetes config files

These files are **not** up to date. They are left here for reference. They did at some point work (and were successfully used with Google Kubernetes Engine). In principle, moving to Kubernetes is a good idea, since it’s more configurable in terms of scaling *pairs* of containers (since Docker Compose can’t do this, the generation scripts are used; this would no longer be required with Kubernetes).
